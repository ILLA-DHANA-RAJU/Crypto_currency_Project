# Create README.md with detailed project explanation
echo # 🪙 Crypto Currency Price Prediction Project > README.md
echo. >> README.md
echo This project is focused on **predicting cryptocurrency price trends** using Machine Learning techniques. It collects real-time or historical crypto data (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum), processes and analyzes it, and then trains ML models to predict future values or classify price movement direction. >> README.md
echo. >> README.md
echo The goal is to help investors and analysts get a better idea of price behavior using intelligent data-driven techniques. It includes both Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and Python scripts for backend/automation. >> README.md
