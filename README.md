 # 🪙 Crypto Currency Price Prediction Project 

This project is focused on **predicting cryptocurrency price trends** using Machine Learning techniques.
It collects real-time or historical crypto data (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum), processes and analyzes it, 
and then trains ML models to predict future values or classify price movement direction. 

The goal is to help investors and analysts get a better idea of price behavior using intelligent data-driven techniques.
It includes both Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and Python scripts for backend/automation.


## 🚀 Features
- 📈 Real-time and historical cryptocurrency data processing
-  🤖 Machine Learning models for prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)
-  📊 Visualization of price trends and prediction results
-  🧠 Easy model training and evaluation using pre-written scripts
-  🌐 (Optional) Flask/Django integration for serving predictions on a web UI
